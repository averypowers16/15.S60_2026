# 15.S60 2026 - Computing in Optimization and Statistics

The "big data revolution" has placed added emphasis on computational techniques for decision-making with data. Large-scale optimization and machine learning are now standard tools among researchers and practitioners alike. More than ever, there is not only a need to develop new methods, but also to implement and apply them computationally in practice.

15.S60 is a workshop on software tools that support data-driven decision-making, with a focus on methods in optimization and statistics. We focus on teaching core principles of computational practice using widely-used software and practical techniques. By the end of the course, students will have a foundational technical skill set for modern research practice.

The course is divided into 8 sessions. Each session will provide participants with the opportunity to learn a specific software tool. The goal of each session is to enable participants to use the software and techniques covered in their own research.


**The 8 modules**:

- Session 1: Terminal, Git, and Github
- Session 2: Data Wrangling and Visualization in R
- Session 3: Introduction to Machine Learning with Python
- Session 4: Deep Learning and Generative AI: Part 1
- Session 5: Deep Learning and Generative AI: Part 2
- Session 6: Advanced Optimization: Part 1
- Session 7: Advanced Optimization: Part 2
- Session 8: High performance computing
