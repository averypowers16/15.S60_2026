# Assignment 3
For this assignment, you will explore the tools learned in class to tackle a Machine Learning (ML)problem of your choice!

Please visit [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/) and select a completed competition (either a regression or a classification task) of your preference.

Create and submit (in Canvas) a notebook that has the following structure:

1) Start with some Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Explain whatyour EDA plots show.

2) Run 2-3 models taught in class and report their performance (in sample and out ofsample), using hyperparameter tuning.

3) Create a weighted ensemble using some of the models

In your final submission, you should have both the notebook you created (as a PDF file), as well as the screenshot of the Kaggle leaderboard.
