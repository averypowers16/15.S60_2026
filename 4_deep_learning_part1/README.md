# Preassignment 4

As preassignment for Session 4, we'll make sure we can open and execute Tensorflow in Google Colab.

Google Colab is a user interface to execute Python code. It is very similar to Jupyter Notebook, except that it is online and runs on GPUs, for free!

Please go to [this link]([https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rCwyWnMYuy8gZWRpSSR81cblFWPyZgXr?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_aFqfqfNIn1vDUeYW7Cx8K0fz0TTbjYJ?usp=sharing)) and make a copy of this repository to your Google drive. For that, please follow the instructions carefully.

Then check you can execute cells as instructed, and upload a screenshot to Canvas of the requested cells.

Extra Resources: If you want to learn about the basics of neural nets and how they work (e.g. backpropagation etc.), check out the Intro to DL + Computer Vision textbook on https://visionbook.mit.edu/; https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks for beautifully animated videos; https://github.com/udlbook/udlbook/tree/main/Notebooks for an educational repo with a big notebook tree organized by chapter (cf. textbook “Understanding Deep Learning").

See you on Thursday 9AM!
