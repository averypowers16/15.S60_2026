# Assignment 4

Homework for Module 4 on Intro to Deep Learning is to complete the 5 questions (5 effectively remaining) of the [Image Classification notebook] https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1L-Dsz_QmqTg4xozJnoUhsYbZN0kKxY0_?usp=sharing. 
I have completed what we saw on class for Q1 and Q2 -- in Q2 you just need to fill out what's missing for the evaluate() function. 

For the backward function in the Linear module, I added some further docstring explaining what it is computing (as I realised I gave a confusing explanation in class :) ) and I also filled out the missing function for the CrossEntropy module.

The main thing is to get used to the Pytorch syntax and see what it is like to train and evaluate a simple CNN model, so don't get caught up with details.
